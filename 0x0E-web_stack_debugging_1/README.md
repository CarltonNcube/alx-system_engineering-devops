0x0E. Web stack debugging #1
This project focuses on debugging web server-related issues, specifically addressing Nginx configuration and port 80 listening. Below are the tasks included in this project:

Task 0
Nginx likes port 80

Debugging skills are put to the test to identify and resolve issues preventing the Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. The task involves using various tools for debugging and creating a Bash script to automate the fix.

Requirements:
Ensure Nginx is running and listening on port 80 of all the server’s active IPv4 IPs.
Write a Bash script that configures a server according to the specified requirements.
Task 1
Make it sweet and short

Building on the previous task, the objective is to create a concise Bash script that addresses the port 80 listening issue with Nginx.

Requirements:
The Bash script must be 5 lines long or less.
There must be a new line at the end of the file.
Adhere to standard Bash script requirements.
Prohibit the use of ;, &&, and wget.
The script should not execute the previous answer file.
Ensure service (init) correctly reports that Nginx is not running.
