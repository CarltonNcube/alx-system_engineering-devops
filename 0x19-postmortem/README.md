Postmortem Report: Server Hack Incident 


Issue Summary:

- Duration: February 15, 2024, 2:00 PM - February 15, 2024, 4:30 PM (UTC)

- Impact:

  - Complete unresponsiveness of the server.

  - Users experienced downtime and intermittent errors.

  - All branches and the head office were unable to access critical services.

Timeline:

Detection:

- 2:00 PM (UTC): Automated security monitoring triggered alerts on unusual access patterns.

- 2:05 PM (UTC): User reports received about service unavailability.

Actions Taken:

- 2:10 PM (UTC): Initiated a thorough investigation into server logs.

- 2:15 PM (UTC): Temporary isolation of the affected server to prevent further damage.

- 2:20 PM (UTC): Engaged the incident response team to assess the situation.

Misleading Paths:

- Initially considered a possible hardware failure due to the sudden unresponsiveness.

- Explored network issues, ruling them out after a brief analysis.

- Assumed a misconfiguration but later found evidence of an external intrusion.

Escalation:

- 2:30 PM (UTC): The incident was escalated to me, as part of the IT and DevOps teams, for further investigation and resolution.

Resolution:

- 3:00 PM (UTC): Identified and patched the specific vulnerability (CVE-2024-12345).

- 3:30 PM (UTC): Thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope of the breach.

- 4:00 PM (UTC): Removed any malicious presence, including backdoors.

- 4:15 PM (UTC): Implemented additional security measures, including firewall rules and enhanced intrusion detection.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

- Exploitation of a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-12345) in an outdated software component (WebServer v2.1).

- The absence of firewalls on the new server increased the attack surface.

Resolution:

- Patched the vulnerable software immediately after detection.

- Conducted a comprehensive security audit to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

- Strengthened server security with updated firewall rules, intrusion detection, and regular vulnerability scans.

Forensic Analysis:

Findings:

- Attacker gained initial access through remote accesses application then got access to mySQL data base.

- Exploited weak passwords to escalate privileges.

- Attempted lateral movement, prevented by isolation measures.

Lessons Learned:

- Prioritize legacy system updates and decommission unsupported software.

- Enforce strong password policies and implement regular security training for all users.

Impact on Branches and Head Office:

Access:

- All branches and the head office were unable to access critical services during the incident.

Restoration Steps:

- 2:10 PM: Communicated promptly with branch and head office teams.

- 2:15 PM: Provided temporary workarounds and alternative access methods.

- 3:00 PM: Implemented a phased restoration plan based on security assessments.

Preventative Measures for Branches and Head Office:

- Enhanced security protocols for remote access.

- Conducted additional training sessions for recognizing and reporting security incidents.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements:

- Enhance the regularity and depth of security audits on all server components.

- Implement a more robust and automated system for monitoring and alerting on potential security breaches.

Tasks:

- 3:30 PM: Schedule recurring training sessions for operations and development teams on secure coding practices.

- 4:00 PM: Establish a response plan for handling security incidents promptly.

- 4:15 PM: Regularly update and patch all software components to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

- 4:30 PM: Implement a centralized log management system for real-time monitoring and analysis.

Conclusion:

The server hack incident emphasizes the critical importance of proactive security measures and ongoing vigilance. As a software engineer, this experience reinforces the commitment to continuous improvement, learning from the incident, and maintaining a robust security posture.
